# data_stream_clustering
Topic: Data stream clustering on low-cost machines using Micropython

All implementation was store in `ulab/micropython/ports/unix/implementation` and the main file is `data_stream_clustering.py`. 

To run the code, you need to stay in `unix` folder, and write this command line: 
`./micropython-2 file_name`

# Note:
- To use `ulab`, you may follow the instruction in github repository here:
